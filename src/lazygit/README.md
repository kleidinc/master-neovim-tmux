# Lazygit

You can perfectly continue to git in the console, switching back and forth between your
editor and the console. But every time you do that, you break your workflow, and risk
leaving 'the flow' or 'the zone'.

There is a reason why master programmers can code for hours on end, and be very productive.
They stay in the 'zone'. It's like being inside a continuous state of focus.

To achieve that you need as little distractions as possible. With lazygit you can achieve
exactly that.

You don't leave your programming environment, you just open-up lazygit, perform the necessary
git commands, in the same environment as your TUI, and continue with work.

This is faster, more efficient, and most important, you stay in the 'zone'. Your programming
workflow isn't broken.

Lazygit offers a much better and richer git experience. Solving merge conflics, undo's,
and even the most advanced git actions become easy, and even fun.
