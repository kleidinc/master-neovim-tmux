# Lazygit

Although you can git in the console, every time you do that, you break your work-flow,
risking distractions and leaving the 'zone'.

If you want to stay in the zone, it's much better to open up lazygit, perform the necessary
git actions, and continue with programming.

This is faster, more efficient, and most important, you stay in the 'zone'. Your programming
workflow isn't broken.

Lazygit offers a much better and richer git experience.

Solving merge conflics, undo's, and advanced git actions become easy and even fun.
