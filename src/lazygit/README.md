# Lazygit

Although you can do anything git in the console, you need to break your flow and leave
the programming environment to the shell, to type the git commands.

It's much better, to stay inside your neovim or tmux and just perform the commits
without leaving. That way you will stay in the zone for longer periods of time,
and be more productive.
