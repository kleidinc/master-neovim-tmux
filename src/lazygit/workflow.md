# Lazygit Workflow

<!-- TODO: Add an example with panels -->

## Staging, committing and pushing changes

Whether you are in the master, or another branch, the workflow stays the same.

1. Launch lazygit with `<prefix> G`, or your personal key-command.

2. Lazygit will launch inside your tmux session. It will automatically
   focus on the window, with the changes. If it's not focussed there,
   press `2`.

3. Select the parts you want to stage with a `space`.

4. If you want to stage all changes press `a`.

5. To commit press `c`.

6. To push the changes press `p`.

7. Leave lazygit, and return to your coding environment press `q`.
