# Lazygit Workflow

Let's say you are writing code in a tmux neovim session.

You save your code and you want to commit.

`<prefix> G`

The lazygit opens inside your tmux session.

You select the parts you want to commit with a `space`.

If you want to stage all changes press `a`.

To commit press `c`.

To push the changes press `p`.

It's as simple as that.

To leave lazygit and return to your coding environment press `q`.
