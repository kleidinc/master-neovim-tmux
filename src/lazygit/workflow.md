# Lazygit Workflow

Let's say you want to stage some changes. You just launch lazygit with
`<prefix> G` or your personal shortcut.

Lazygit will launch inside your tmux session. It will automatically
focus on the window.

You select the parts you want to stage with a `space`.
If you want to stage all changes press `a`.

To commit press `c`.

To push the changes press `p`.

To leave lazygit and return to your coding environment press `q`.
