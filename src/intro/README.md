# Why this book

If you plan on becoming a master programmer, you will be programming for the majority of
your life. Even if you move up the career-ladder, you still will have to write code,
review code, refactor code and tinker. This will be something you will be doing daily.
And this is also how you will achieve and keep your mastery.

Your programming environment is as important as the languages you master, because you will
be using it daily for the rest of your life.

That's why mastering how to setup, configure, and program your programming environment is
as important as the code you will be writing.

The default config in this book is set up for Rust, markdown, lua you can easily extend it
to any programming language you want.

# Touch-typing on a split-keyboard

The mainstream keyboards are not optimized for programmers. That's why you will often see
proficient coders using mechanical keyboards, and evern split keyboards.

Your keyboard is your best friend. You will be using your keyboard through-out your whole
coding career. Touch typing is essential. Although you can start working with a mainstream
keyboard, I strongly suggest you get a mechanical split keyboard or at least a mechanical one.

The benefit of mechanical keys is that your fingers, and thus your brain, receives feedback.
That way you will learn to type faster easier.

And don't worry, if are not like me, who lives outside in the wilderness, you can choose
silent keys with a split keyboard:). I love nature, but that's for another time.

# Switch to Neovim and Tmux

I have a love-hate relationship with open-source. But it has given us amazing development
tools as neovim, tmux, and a never-ending influx of usefull plugins and a thriving community
around it.

_The reason why I feel that open-source is broken, is that people, who provide truly useful
code, are not adequately rewarded. I haven't yet figured out how to fix that, but at least
I am now also giving back to the community by writing this book._

First I switched to Neovim, and then added tmux to my environment, and now I can't even imagine
going back to some 'commercial' product.

There are no commercially available closed-source products available that can approach my
current workflow. I've become much faster. I can switch back and forth between projects in a few
keystrokes.

And trust me, once you start working with keys, bypassing the mouse, you will train your mechanical
memory and after a few months, you won't even have to think about keymaps. It will become as
natural as breathing.

This book will guide you through the process of installing, and configuring your neovim, and tmux
configs, and also introduce some essential plugins.

# Read books, documentation and source-code of open-source projects

Our brains can process books quite good. Books are treasure-troves of information. I never thought I would
have to explain the benefits of a book, but here goes:

1. The information is structured, and you can easily find it.
2. You can read, re-read, ... and apply the steps.

The reason why I am writing this book, is because I haven't found a book covering how to configure your
development environment. There are thousands of mixed-quality videos and so called-tutorials, but the absolute
majority won't give you a complete setup.

Read documentation.

Read source-code of open source projects.

# Use AI wisely

First of all, AI is just machine learning from other people's code. So called AI can
not assertain the true quality of other people's code it is 'learning' from.

Garbage in, garbage out.

Every
AI agent needs to learn from something. It needs data. Most of it, if not all, was
scraped from github, gitlab, and other repositories. If all code used to train the AI
was perfect, then yes, over time we, the programmers, would become obsolete. But, guess what
, there is a reason why Windows, Linux, Android, Apple constantly pushes so-called security patches, and updates.

Even
the code of the tech monopolies is flaud. I am not even talking about the code from
repo's used for training AI.

### When to use AI

Only if you can't fix a problem yourself, try AI, and treat it as a stupid helper, a sort
of second opinion. Don't trust it 100%. Trust but verify, applies here.

Very important. Do not rely on AI to do the work for you. If AI can do it, you're not
even a programmer.

## Train your Programmer's brain

Your brain is much more powerful than the strongest AI. When you write code yourself,
your brain works. When you are thinking about a coding problem, your brain works.
When you are refactoring code, your brain works.

Your brain will continuously practice and it will improve. Practice makes perfect.
And as you program more and more, and solve difficult problems, you will reach mastery.

You can only achieve mastery if you put in the work.

I will leave you with two thoughts.

_When you are copy-pasting code snippets from an AI agent, your brain becomes lazy, and
you become stupid, and over time totally irrelevant and fired._

_You can't learn to play the piano, by watching someone else play the piano in a video. It's
the same for coding. If you don't want to become irrelevant in 3 to 5 years, you need to code
without AI. Then, and only then, will you reach a proficiency that will empower you to be
part of the 1% of coders, who will still have a job._
