This book is heavily inspired by the open source code, and video tutorials of TJ Devries
(Neovim), Primagen (Harpoon), Jon Gjengset (Rust Decrusting), Hector (Iced), and many,
many others.

Writing this book is my way of doing something back for the community, which directly and
indirectly made me into a better programmer.

# Friendly Advice for Anyone Using Open Source

I know that everyone already knows this. But still:).

1. Make sure to add a star on any repository, you are using in your toolkit.
   It doesn't cost you anything, but it shows your support for the work people
   do. Or you can as I am doing, and contribute back to the community.

2. If your company uses open source, and its profitable, become a sponsor
   or contribute by other means.
