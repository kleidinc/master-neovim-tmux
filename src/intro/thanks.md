This book is heavily inspired by the open source, and video contributions of TJ Devries (Neovim),
Primagen (Overal advice, Neovim Harpoon), Jon Gjengset (Rust 0.1% Jedi Master), Hector (Amazing Iced), ...
and many, many others.

Writing this book is my way of doing something back for the community, that directly and indirectly
made me into a better programmer.
