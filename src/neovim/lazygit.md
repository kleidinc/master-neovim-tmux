# Lazygit

Although it's always good to learn the basic git commands. Over time it is
better to implement Lazygit into your programming workflow, to make things more
user-friendly, fast and enjoyable.

## Basic Git commands

You can achieve most things with just your shell. These are the commands I used
on a daily basic from my shell.

`git init`
`git add .`
`git commit -m "<commit message>"`
`git push -u origin master`

`git default ...`
`git add origin`

`git checkout -b <new_brach_name>`
`git checkout master`
`git merge <new_branch_name>`
`git push -u origin master`
