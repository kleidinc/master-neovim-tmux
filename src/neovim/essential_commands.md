### [Focus](https://github.com/cdmill/focus.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file)

This is the best plugin to code distraction free. You can remove everything except the
line numbers.

I have it mapped to to `<leader>fo` fo for focus. For me it removes the status-bar for
both neovim, tmux and the diagnostics.

It is very annoying to see diagnostic errors as you are typing. My workflow is mostly
firt coding and only after I finished the structure, I deactivate focus mode, and go
through the diagnostics.
