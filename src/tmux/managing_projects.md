# Managing Projects

Since I am mainly programming in Rust, I am currently testin the tmux-sessionizer.

# How to start the session chooser?

`tms switch`

## How to add directories to search for projects to add to the tms list

You can use the `tms config -p <path>` to add them, or add them in the
config file `~/.config/tmux/`

## Inside a session launch the tms session window

`<prefix> w`
`<prefix> s`

To select a session from the list you can use the up,down keys.
To leave escape.

## To rename a session

`<prefix> r`

It is short, but then again ... .
