# Install tmux plugins

To get the most out of tmux you should install some essential plugins.

## Keep tmux sessions persistent accross restarts

After installing tmux-continuum and tmux ressurrect you can restart your workstation or server,
and still keep all the sessions alive. Without those 2 plugins, you would loose all sessions
every time you reboot or restart or server or workstation.
