# Maybe Nvim Plugins

Plugins I used but disabled.

### [lsp_lines](https://github.com/maan2003/lsp_lines.nvim)

The problem was that although the plugin did as advertised it messed up the screen
too much, and made fixing errors horrible.

A good learning project would be to create a shortcut to show a popup with the full
diagnostic on the line of the error. So you can read it, understand what's wrong,
and then it can be removed, so you focus on fixing the bug, without the diagnostic
being in the way.
